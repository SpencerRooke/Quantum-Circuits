# QC Simulation 
A small and probably poorly written python library for creating/simulating quantum circuits, only relies on numpy and should work for any python version 3.x
qClass.py provides some methods, while qGates.py includes some of the more common quantum gates
Grover.py and Shor.py are two example implementations of quantum algorithms implemented with the above
